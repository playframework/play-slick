# Play Slick

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/playframework/play-slick.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/playframework/play-slick) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/playframework/play-slick/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/playframework/play-slick?branch=master)

The Play Slick module makes [Slick] a first-class citizen of [Play]. It consists of two features:

- Integration of Slick into Play's application lifecycle.
- Support for Play database evolutions.

Because Slick creates and manages both a connection pool and a thread pool, integrating Slick with Play boils down to ensuring that all resources allocated by Slick are shutdown when a Play application is stopped (or reloaded).

[Slick]: http://slick.typesafe.com

The plugin has its own release cycle and therefore is not integrated into either core Play or Slick.

## Current Version

To use play-slick, you need to add the following dependencies:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-slick" % "4.0.0",
  "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-slick-evolutions" % "4.0.0"
)
```

Or use a version that is compatible with the Play version you are using. See all available versions below.
